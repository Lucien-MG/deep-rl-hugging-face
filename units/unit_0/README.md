## Content

In this course:

- Study Deep Reinforcement Learning in theory and practice.
- Learn to use famous Deep RL libraries such as Stable Baselines3, RL Baselines3 Zoo, Sample Factory and CleanRL.
- Train agents in unique environments such as SnowballFight, Huggy the Doggo, VizDoom (Doom) and classical ones such as Space Invaders, PyBullet and more.
- Share your trained agents with one line of code to the Hub and also download powerful agents from the community.
- Participate in challenges where you will evaluate your agents against other teams. You’ll also get to play against the agents you’ll train.

## My word

**In essence, this course provides a strong foundation in DRL, equipping learners with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills to build and deploy intelligent agents that can learn to excel in a wide range of challenging tasks.**

I'm excited to share my learning journey and progress with the community!
