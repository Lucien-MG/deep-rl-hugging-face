# Bonus Unit 1: Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning with Huggy

In this bonus unit, weâ€™ll reinforce what we learned in the first unit by teaching Huggy the Dog
to fetch the stick and then play with him directly in your browser.

## Train:

To train the agent run:

```bash
mlagents-learn ./Huggy.yaml --env=./envs/Huggy/Huggy.x86_64 --run-id="Huggy" --no-graphics
```

## Push trained agent to hugging face:

To push your model, first login to hugging face:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

then push with the command:

```bash
mlagents-push-to-hf --run-id="Huggy" --local-dir="./results/Huggy" --repo-id="Username/ppo-Huggy" --commit-message="Your Message"
```

## Dependencies

First execute the dependecies.sh script to download everything we need:
```bash
sh dependencies.sh
```

then install ml-agents:
```bash
pip install -e ml-agents/ml-agents-envs
pip install -e ml-agents/ml-agents
```
