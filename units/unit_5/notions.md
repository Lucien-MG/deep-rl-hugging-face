# An Introduction to Unity ML-Agents

One of the challenges in Reinforcement Learning is creating environments.  
Fortunately for us, we can use game engines to do so.  
These engines, such as Unity, Godot or Unreal Engine, are programs made to create video games.  
They are perfectly suited for creating environments: they provide physics systems, 2D/3D rendering, and more.

One of them, Unity, created the Unity ML-Agents Toolkit,  
a plugin based on the game engine Unity that allows us to use the Unity Game Engine as an environment builder to train agents.  
In the first bonus unit, this is what we used to train Huggy to catch a stick!
